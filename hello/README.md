# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat run --network <network-name> scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Deployed

```
$  ~/Desktop/temp/project git:(main) ✗ npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network sepolia
Compiled 7 Solidity files successfully (evm target: paris).
Contract deployed to 0xE3F89b55Fce0E95cb1C0B1fDFd548036B2653eB7
